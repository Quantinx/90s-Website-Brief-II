        <article class="content-article">
          The show was launched by ABC in 1987 and, despite reviews dismissing
          the show as mediocre, was a hit with American audiences. For much of
          the late 80s-early 90s, Horsin' Around was a major success, to the
          point of regular guest appearances from various celebrities and major
          figures of the time including wrestler Hulk Hogan, baseball player
          Jose Canseco, supermodel Cindy Crawfish, actress Erika Eleniak, O.J.
          Simpson defense attorney Barry Scheck, and even former first lady
          Nancy Reagan. Horsin' Around was also rather progressive for the time,
          as there are episodes that attempt to touch upon social issues such as
          racism, drug use, and the Armenian Genocide. Despite this, the show
          also occasionally included anti-Semitic humor, as observed in the
          first Christmas special. By the early-mid 1990s, the show began to
          decline with the debut of rival sitcom Mr. Peanutbutter's House, which
          went on to be even more successful than Horsin' Around despite being a
          blatant ripoff and having worse reviews.
